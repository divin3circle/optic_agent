# Optic Agent 

A Typescript Agent for the Optic Platform.

## Workflow

It's assumed, at least for now that only ckUSDC tokens are sent to these canister. After receiving enough ckUSDC based on the set thresh-hold, the agent will run two operations. A swap action to swap half of the available ckUSDC value to either ICP or ckBTC, followed by a add liquidity action to provide liquidity to the relevant pool. These actions are provided by ICPSwap [here](https://github.com/ICPSwap-Labs/docs).

All swap, add liquidity actions are recorded into the canister's satble memory for auditing and performance analysis. This is true also for all the error messages encountered during swap or add liquidity actions.

This canister also provides a function to check the available fees earned by the pool on it's investment on the said pool. 

## Functions

âœ…`getBalance` returns the ckUSDC and ICP balances of the canister in decimals
ðŸ”‚`swap` swaps portion of treasury ckUSDC to ICP
ðŸ”‚`balance` gets the amount of ckUSDC to swap to ICP to get a balanced USD value ratio
ðŸ”‚`getICPUSDValue` gets current ICP value in USD
ðŸ”‚`addLiquidity` adds liquidity to the ICP/ckUSDC pool
ðŸ”‚`get
